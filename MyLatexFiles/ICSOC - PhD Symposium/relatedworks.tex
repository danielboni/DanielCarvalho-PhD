The related works concerning the problem stated in the previous section can be divided in three topics: (\textit{i}) data integration approaches in the cloud or in service-oriented contexts; (\textit{ii}) query rewriting approaches; and (\textit{iii}) service level agreements for cloud computing.

The authors in~\cite{Correndo2010,ElSheikh2013} perform data integration in service-oriented contexts, particularly considering data services. However, they only take into consideration the requirement of computing resources for integrating data focusing on performance aspects. \cite{YauY08} focused on data privacy in order to integrate data obtained from different data services. \cite{Tian2010} proposed an inter-cloud data integration system considering privacy requirements and the cost for protecting and processing data. Although \cite{YauY08,Tian2010} tackled some quality aspects of the integration, we believe there are other crucial aspects that should be studied regarding the requirements and constraints of data consumers, data provider, the associated infrastructure, and the data itself.

As traditional databases theory, data integration on cloud and service-oriented context deals with query rewriting issues. Researches~\cite{ba2014,Barhamgi2010,Benouaret2011,Umberto} have refereed to it as a service composition problem in which given a query the objective is to lookup and compose data services that can contribute to produce a result. In general, these works share the same performance problem depending on the size of the query and on the number of available services. Although \cite{ba2014,Benouaret2011} have considered preferences and scores to produce rewritings, requirements and constraints according to the data consumer, the data provider, the integration infrastructure, and the data must be considered in this new vision of data integration. 

Service level agreements (SLA) have been widely adopted in different domains in order to specify what service consumer can expect from the service delivered by a service provider. Research contributions in cloud computing mainly concern (i) SLA negotiation phase (step in which the contracts are established between customers and providers) and (ii) monitoring and allocation of cloud resources to detect and avoid SLA violations. We strongly believe that SLAs could be used in order to cover the limitations discussed in the previous paragraphs and to enhance the quality in the current data integration solutions. In this sense, current SLA models are not sufficient to cover the data integration requirements considering the new vision on multi-cloud contexts.
