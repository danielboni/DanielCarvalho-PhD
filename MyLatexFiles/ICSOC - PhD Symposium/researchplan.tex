SLA incompatibilities are not treated in this paper. Currently we are working on this issue, and improving our SLA model and schema for data integration adapted to the multi-cloud context.  Another important part is how to make efficient the rewriting process by reducing the composition search space. Finally, how should be a parallel execution of the query plan to let the execution efficient in the multi-cloud. In addition, we are focusing on evaluating and validating the entire quality-based data integration approach on a multi-cloud environment.
