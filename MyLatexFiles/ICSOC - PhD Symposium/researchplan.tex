We started proposing a query rewriting algorithm called \textit{Rhone}. It serves as proof of concept for the feasibility of our data integration process guided by cloud constraints and user preferences~\cite{carvalho2016}. The first results are promising: \textit{Rhone} reduces the rewriting number and processing time while considering user preferences and services' quality aspects extracted from SLAs to guide the service selection and rewriting. Furthermore, the integration quality is enhanced, and the integration total cost is reduced. For the time being, quality enhancement is  assessed through benchmarks and use cases deployed on an experimental multi-cloud environment. 

We are currently working on an SLA model for the integration process to express the constraints and the quality feature of a previous data integration. %an SLA model   to be adapted to the requirements and constraints imposed by the multi-cloud context.  
Other important research aspects are how to make efficient the rewriting process by reducing the composition search space.
