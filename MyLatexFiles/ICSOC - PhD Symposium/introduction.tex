Current data integration systems imply consuming and integrating data from data services which deliver data under different quality conditions related to freshness, trust, cost, reliability, availability, among others. Selecting data services, producing query rewritings and executing query plans are computationally expensive. These data integration tasks can take advantages from multi-cloud architectures considering their elasticity, \textit{pay-per-use} model and parallel processing.

Data integration environments bring new challenges to multi-cloud due to 4
principal dimensions, they are: \textit{data provider, data consumer,
infrastructure}, and the \textit{data}. By the other hand, multi-cloud imposes at
real-time their associated constraints and characteristics such as access policies, access constraints,
processing capacity, memory limits, among others.

To better understand our problem, let us suppose the following scenario. 
During Brazilian Olympic games 2016, Lucas is an spectator willing to collect information about the weather forecast near his actual location with a time interval of two days in advance. According to the weather different matches could be proposed, in different stadiums with different options of seats to buy (such as sunny seats or not, in the middle or in the sides, and in the side of a specific team).
%
Lucas may also have several preferences such privacy issues, time interval, budget, using free services or not, for instance. 
%
To achieve his needs, there are several data provider services distributed on
different clouds that can be integrated to produce an answer for his query or
part of it. Lucas must be subscribed in the cloud to have access to its
informations and the cloud service location is known. From this, he
is able to create his query.
%
Thus, given a user query, the integration process deals with different matching problems: 
(i) matching the \textit{query} and \textit{data provider services} - the data provider services have to produce a result for the query; 
(ii) matching the \textit{user preferences} and the \textit{quality guarantees} provided by the data provider - the user preferences and requirements concern the data itself, the data services and the type of subscription the user has with the clouds; 
(iii) matching the \textit{user preferences} and \textit{user' type of subscriptions} - the user may have several subscriptions with different clouds that should influence the way to choose the services if the underlying cloud offers more resources to the user, and this cloud can be running out of budget for consuming the necessary resources; and 
(iv) the \textit{data provider services} and \textit{their type of subscriptions} - the data provider services also have  subscription with the clouds, and they can also be out of budget and resources according to their subscription.

The quality conditions that the user can expect from a service are defined in
contracts called service level agreements (SLA), in a multi-cloud environment.
%
Current SLA models are not sufficient to cover the data integration requirements. 
%
Usually, SLAs describe only cloud resources, and do not tackle the data integration aspects. 
%
Thus, we strongly believe that: 
(\textit{i}) a new kind of SLA is need to unify all information regarding the constraints and requirements as a meaning for the integration process; and 
(\textit{ii}) by using the new SLA, the integration history could be reused as much as possible to enhance the quality and performance in the current data integration solutions. 

Considering the problems and challenges aforementioned, this PhD project
contributes designing a SLA model and an approach for data integration adapted
to the cloud economic model. The originality of our approach consists in guiding
the entire data integration solution - while selecting, filtering and composing
cloud services, and delivering the results - taking into account (\textit{a})
user preferences statements; (\textit{b}) SLA contracts exported by different
cloud providers; and (\textit{c}) several QoS measures associated to data
collections properties (for instance, trust, privacy, economic cost); and
(\textit{d}) validation of our approach in a multi-cloud scenario.        

The reminder of this paper is organized as follows.
Section 2 discusses the related works.
Section 3 presents our SLA-based data integration approach
Section 4 describes the preliminary results, and finally, section 5 presents
our conclusions and research plan.
