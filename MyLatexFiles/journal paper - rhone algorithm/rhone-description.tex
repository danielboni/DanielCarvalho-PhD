This section describes the service-based query rewriting algorithm, called \textit{Rhone}, that we propose. 
%
Given a set of \textit{abstract services}, a set of \textit{concrete services}, a
\textit{user query} and a set of user \textit{quality preferences}, the \textit{Rhone} derives a set
of service compositions that answer the query and that fulfill the quality preferences regarding the 
context of data service deployment.
%

The algorithm consist in three macro-steps: 
(\textit{i}) select services; 
(\textit{ii}) create variable mappings from services to the query; and 
(\textit{iii}) produce rewriting that matches with the query. 
In the following lines, basic definitions are presented to explain and describe each step of the 
algorithm in detail.
