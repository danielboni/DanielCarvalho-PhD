\section{Data Integration Approaches}

The summaries for data integration are the ones I used in the first version of the related works on our paper~\cite{075,078,Nie07,096,Yau08}. I have no summaries of the data integration approaches I read before (I recently started doing the summaries), but this is the complete list I have read~\cite{066,067,070,072,113,077,Dustdar:2012,081,110,111,094,099,102}. Considering these papers, most of them are frameworks/systems for data integration. Excepting the articles concerning the Google fusion tables~\cite{Gonzalez:2010,Gonzalez:2010b}, none of the works until now presented (clearly) how they integrate data (there is only a superficial description of the approach). The works focus on data quality aspects such as cost, privacy, protection and security of their integration approach. In~\cite{Lenzerini:2002}, a theoretical perspective of data integration is presented, focusing on aspects such as modeling data integration applications, inconsistencies between sources, reasoning on queries and query rewriting.
