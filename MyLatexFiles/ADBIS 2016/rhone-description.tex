This section describes the service-based query rewriting algorithm, called
\textit{Rhone}.%, that we propose.
%

Given a set of \textit{abstract services}, a set of \textit{concrete services}, a
\textit{user query} and a set of \textit{user quality preferences}, the
\textit{Rhone} derives a set of service compositions. These service compositions 
answer the query and that fulfill the quality preferences regarding the context of data service deployment.
%

%
The algorithm consists in four macro-steps: 
(\textit{i}) select services; 
(\textit{ii}) create variable mappings from services to the query; and 
(\textit{iii}) combine the services and 
(\textit{iv}) produce rewriting that matches with the query. 
% In the following lines, basic definitions are presented to explain and describe each step of the 
% algorithm in detail.
