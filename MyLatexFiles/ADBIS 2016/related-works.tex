The main aspect in a data integration solution is 
the query rewriting process executed by a mediator
in accordance with the different databases.
%
In this way, algorithms for rewriting queries have
been proposed in two domains: (1) on the database 
domain; and (2) on the service-oriented domain.

On the database domain, query rewriting approaches using
views have been widely discussed~\cite{Halevy:2001}.
%
The \textit{bucket algorithm}~\cite{Levy:1996}, 
\textit{inverse-rules algorithm}~\cite{Duschka:1997} and 
\textit{MiniCon algorithm}~\cite{Pottinger:2001} have
tackled the rewriting problem on the database domain.
%
In addition, these algorithms have also inspired other
algorithms in the database and service-oriented domains.
These approaches will not be detailed here once the focus
of this paper is on algorithms in the service-oriented domain.

Generally, data integration solutions on the 
service-oriented domain deal with query rewriting problems.
%
\cite{Barhamgi2010} proposed a query rewriting approach 
which processes queries on data provider services.
The query and data services are modeled as RDF views.
A rewriting answer is a service composition in which 
the set of data service graphs fully satisfy the query graph.  
%
\cite{Benouaret2011} introduced a service composition
framework to answer preference queries. In that approach, two algorithms based
on~\cite{Barhamgi2010} are presented to rank the best rewritings based on previously computed scores.
%
\cite{ba2014} presented an algorithm based on \textit{MiniCon} 
that produces and order rewritings according to user preferences. 
The user preferences on this approach are scores used to rank 
services that should be previously define by the user.
%
Our approach differs from these works in three aspects:
(1) the user can express quality measures and associate them
to his queries, such as: \textit{I want to use services with response
time less than 2 seconds, price per request less than 1 dollar
and location close to my city}; 
(2) the user preferences guides the service selection. 
These preferences are matched with the services' quality aspects
that are extracted from service level agreement contracts.
Here, it is important to highlight that there
is a previous phase in which the services' quality aspects are 
processed and extracted from SLAs. 
In this paper, we are assuming that these information are accessible and
well-formatted to the algorithm; and
(3) the user preferences are also used to guide the rewriting process.
The rewriting answers (services compositions) produced must be in 
accordance with the user preferences.
%
Summarizing, the main and original idea is to use SLA to guide
the entire data integration process.
Yet, to the best of our knowledge, few works consider quality
measures associated both to data services and to user preferences in order to
guide the rewriting process, and there is no approach using SLAs to guide the
data integration solution.
