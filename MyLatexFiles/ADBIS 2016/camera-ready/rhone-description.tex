This section describes our quality-based query rewriting algorithm called \textit{Rhone}. It is guided by user requirements and constraints, and services' quality features extracted after structuring service level agreements (SLA). Our algorithm has two original aspects: \textit{first}, the user can express his/her quality requirements and constraints, and associate them to his/her queries; and, \textit{second}, service's quality features defined on Service Level Agreements (SLA) guide service selection and the whole rewriting process. 

\subsection{Preliminaries}

The idea behind our algorithm consists in deriving a set of service compositions that fulfill the users' integration preferences and requirements concerning the context of data service deployment given a set of \textit{abstract services}, a set of \textit{concrete services}, a user' \textit{query} defined hereafter and a set of user' \textit{integration preferences and requirements}.
