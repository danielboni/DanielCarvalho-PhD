\textit{Rhone} still need to be tested in a large scale case and in a context of
parallel multi-tenant to test efficacy. 
% This work proposes a query rewriting
% algorithm for data integration quality named \textit{Rhone}. Given a query, user preferences and a list of concrete services as input,
% the algorithm derives rewritings in terms of concrete services that matches with the query and
% fulfill the user preferences. The formalization and experiments are presented. 
However, the results can show that the \textit{Rhone} reduces the rewriting
number and processing time while considering user preferences and services'
quality aspects extracted from SLAs to guide the service selection and rewriting.
We are currently performing a multi-cloud simulation in order to evaluate the
performance of the \textit{Rhone} in such context.
