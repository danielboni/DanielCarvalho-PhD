We have developed a prototype of our query rewriting algorithm (called \textit{Rhone}) which takes into consideration users' requirements and services' quality aspects extracted from SLAs.
The Rhone prototype is implemented in Java.
It includes 15 java classes in which 14 of them model the basic concepts 
(\textit{query}, \textit{abstract services}, \textit{concrete services}, etc), 
and 1 responsible to implement the core of the algorithm. 

Currently, our approach runs in a controlled environment. 
Different experiments were produced to analyze the algorithm's behavior.
We will present two experiments: \textit{experiment 1} and \textit{experiment 2}.
The service registry used has 100 concrete services. 
In each experiment, there are a set of tests in which the number of concrete 
services varies from 5 until to reach 100.

The \textit{experiment 2} (figure~\ref{fig:fig02}) presents the results while testing the algorithm in the presence of user preferences and services' quality aspects extracted from SLAs.  The difference between \textit{Test 1} and \textit{Test 2} concerns the way services are selected and the query is rewritten. Once \textit{Test 1} do not consider quality measures as any other existing query rewriting approach, \textit{Test 2} uses the user preferences statements and services' quality aspects to guide the service selection and query rewriting.
Both include queries with six abstract services and quality requirements concerning availability, response time, price per call and integration cost (total cost). The figure~\ref{fig:fig02} shows our results.

The results while considering user preferences and SLAs are promisingly.  
%The \textit{Rhone} presents a better performance, decreasing the processing time and 
%the total number of rewritings produced.  
%Reducing rewriting number allow to go straightforward to the rewriting solutions that are satisfactory avoiding any further backtrack.
The \textit{Rhone} increases performance reducing rewriting number (around 50 percent) which allows to go straightforward to the rewriting solutions that are satisfactory avoiding any further backtrack and thus reducing successful integration time. Moreover, once the services selection and service composition (rewritings) process are fully guided by the user requirements and SLA, the algorithm avoid producing and executing composition that are not interest for the user. In this sense, the reduces the integration economic cost while delivering the expected results.
