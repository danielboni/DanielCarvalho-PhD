We have developed a prototype of our query rewriting algorithm (called \textit{Rhone}) which takes into consideration users' requirements and services' quality aspects extracted from SLAs. The \textit{Rhone} prototype is implemented in Java.

Currently, our approach runs in a local controlled environment including a service registry of 100 concrete services. 
Experiments were produced to analyze the algorithm's behavior concerning performance, and quality and cost of the integration. The figures~\ref{fig01} and \ref{fig02} summarize our first results.

The experiments include two different approaches: (i) the \textit{tradition approach} in which user preferences and SLAs are not considered; and (ii) the \textit{preference-guided approach} which considers the users' integration requirements and SLAs.

The results while considering user preferences and SLAs are promisingly.  
The \textit{Rhone} increases performance reducing rewriting number which allows to go straightforward to the rewriting solutions that are satisfactory avoiding any further backtrack and thus reducing successful integration time~\ref{fig01}. Moreover, using the \textit{preferences-guided approach} to meet the user preferences, the quality of the rewritings produced has enhanced and the integration economic cost has considerable reduced while delivering the expected results~\ref{fig02}.
