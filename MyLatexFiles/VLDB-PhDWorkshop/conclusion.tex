This paper introduces a new vision of data integration adapted to the cloud economic model. It also proposes a new approach for data integration based on user integration requirements and SLA. In addition, an query rewriting algorithm called \textit{Rhone} servers as proof of concept. Our preliminary results have shown that the \textit{Rhone} reduces the rewriting number and processing time while considering user preferences and services' quality aspects extracted from SLAs to guide the service selection and rewriting. Furthermore, the integration quality is enhanced, and it is adapted to cloud economic model reducing the total cost of the integration.

Currently we are improving our SLA model and schema for data integration adapted
to the multi-cloud context.  In addition, we are working on evaluating the
proposal approach on a multi-cloud environment. Then, we will validate our
entire quality-based data integration approach.
