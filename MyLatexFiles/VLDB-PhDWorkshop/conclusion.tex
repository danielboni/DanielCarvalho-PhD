This work proposes a query rewriting algorithm for data integration quality
named \textit{Rhone}. Given a query, user preferences and a list of concrete services as input,
the algorithm derives rewritings in terms of concrete services that matches with the query and
fulfill the user preferences. The formalization and experiments are presented. The results 
show that the \textit{Rhone} reduces the rewriting number and processing time while considering 
user preferences and services' quality aspects extracted from SLAs to guide the service selection and rewriting.
We are currently performing improvements in the implementation and setting up a
multi-cloud simulation in in order to evaluate the performance of the
\textit{Rhone} in such context.
