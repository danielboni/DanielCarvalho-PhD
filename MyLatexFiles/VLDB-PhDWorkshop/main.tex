% ****************** AUTHORS **************************************

% You need the command \numberofauthors to handle the 'placement
% and alignment' of the authors beneath the title.
%
% For aesthetic reasons, we recommend 'three authors at a time'
% i.e. three 'name/affiliation blocks' be placed beneath the title.
%
% NOTE: You are NOT restricted in how many 'rows' of
% "name/affiliations" may appear. We just ask that you restrict
% the number of 'columns' to three.
% 
% Because of the available 'opening page real-estate'
% we ask you to refrain from putting more than six authors
% (two rows with three columns) beneath the article title.
% More than six makes the first-page appear very cluttered indeed.
%
% Use the \alignauthor commands to handle the names
% and affiliations for an 'aesthetic maximum' of six authors.
% Add names, affiliations, addresses for
% the seventh etc. author(s) as the argument for the
% \additionalauthors command.
% These 'additional authors' will be output/set for you
% without further effort on your part as the last section in
% the body of your article BEFORE References or any Appendices.

\numberofauthors{1} %  in this sample file, there are a *total*
% of EIGHT authors. SIX appear on the 'first-page' (for formatting
% reasons) and the remaining two appear in the \additionalauthors section.

\author{  
% You can go ahead and credit any number of authors here,
% e.g. one 'row of three' or two rows (consisting of one row of three
% and a second row of one, two or three).
%
% The command \alignauthor (no curly braces needed) should
% precede each author name, affiliation/snail-mail address and
% e-mail address. Additionally, tag each line of
% affiliation/address with \affaddr, and tag the
% e-mail address with \email.

% There's nothing stopping you putting the seventh, eighth, etc.
% author on the opening page (as the 'third row') but we ask,
% for aesthetic reasons that you place these 'additional authors'
% in the \additional authors block, viz.
%\date{30 July 1999}
% Just remember to make sure that the TOTAL number of authors
% is the number that will appear on the first page PLUS the

\begin{abstract}
In the traditional databases theory, data integration is a problem of merging data from data sources in order to provide a unified view of this data to the user. This PhD project address data integration in multi-cloud environments. Current data integration systems implies consuming data from data services deployed in cloud contexts and integrating the results.
%
The project takes a new angle of the problem by proposing an SLA-based data integration approach in a multi-cloud environment which considers users' integration preferences (including quality constrains and data requirements) to be matched with the services' quality constraints extracted from their SLAs while delivering the results. 
%The project takes a new angle of the problem by proposing an SLA-based approach, which given a user query and her integration preferences, to match the user preferences (such as whether she accepts to pay for the data, its provenance, freshness and how much she is ready to pay for the integration, among others) with the services' SLA deployed in a multi-cloud context while delivering the results according to the users' integration context.
%
The objective is to enhance the quality and performance on data integration taking into consideration the economic model imposed by the cloud. At this stage, Our first results have shown that quality and performance can be enhanced, and the cost of the integration can be minimized by using our approach.
