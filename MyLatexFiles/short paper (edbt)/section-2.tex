\section{Implementation and Results}
\label{sec:implementationandresults}  
Let us suppose the following medical scenario to illustrate our service-based query rewriting algorithm. 
Users can access \textit{abstract services} (basic service capabilities) to retrieve: (i) patients infected by a given disease (\textit{DiseasePatients(d?,p!)});
(ii) patient dna information \textit{PatientDNA(p?, dna!)}; and (iii) patient personal information (\textit{PatientInformation(p?, info!)}).
%To perform these function consider the \textit{abstract services}: (i)
%, (ii)  and (iii)
%.
The decorations ? and ! are used to specify input and output parameters, respectively. 

%Users can retrieve information about patients, diseases, dna information and others.
%To perform these function consider the \textit{abstract services}: (i)
%\textit{DiseasePatients(d?,p!)}, (ii) \textit{PatientDNA(p?,dna!)} and (iii)
%\textit{PatientInformation(p?,info!)}.
%The decorations ? and ! are used to specify input and output parameters, respectively.

%In our scenario, a \textit{query} expresses an abstract composition that
% describes the requirements of a user.
%\textit{Queries} and \textit{concrete services} are defined in terms of
% \textit{abstract services}.
%They can be associated to a single \textit{abstract service} or to a
% composition of them.

Let us consider the query: \textit{a user wants to retrieve personal and DNA information of patients who were infected by a disease `K' using services that have availability higher than 98\%, price per call less than 0.2 dollars, and total cost less than 1 dollar.} 
The query below corresponds to the example (see Definition 1).
% A query $Q$ tagged with user preferences is defined in accordance with the grammar:
% \begin{center}
% $Q (\overline{I}, \overline{O}) := A_{1}(\overline{I}, \overline{O}), A_{2}(\overline{I}, \overline{O}), ..,  A_{n}(\overline{I}, \overline{O})[P_{1},P_{2}, .., P_{k}]$
% \end{center}
% where the left side is the \textit{head} of the query; and the right side is the \textit{body}. 
% $\overline{I}$ and $\overline{O}$ are a set of \textit{input} and \textit{output} parameters, respectively.
% Input parameters present in both sides of the definition are called \textit{head variables}.
% In contrast, input parameters only in the body are called \textit{local variables}.
% $A_{1}, A_{2}, .., A_{n}$ are \textit{abstract services}.
% $P_{1}, P_{2}, .., P_{k}$ are user preferences (over the services). Preferences are in the form $x \otimes constant$ such that $\otimes \in\lbrace \geq, \leq, =, \neq, <, >\rbrace$.

%The query which express the example following our grammar is below.
%The decorations ? and ! are used to specify input and output parameters, respectively. 
\begin{small}
\begin{center}
$Q (d?, dna!) := DiseasePatients(d?, p!), PatientDNA(p?, dna!),$ \\
$[availability > 99\%, \ price \ per \ call < 0.2\$, \ total \ cost < 1\$]$
\end{center} 
\end{small}

%We highlight that in the query there are two types of preferences (let's refer
%to them as \textit{measures}): \textit{single measures} (availability and price
%per call) and \textit{composed measures} (total cost).
%The \textit{single measures} are the simplest type. It is a static measure
% which is has a name associated with an operation and a value. The\textit{ composed measure} is dynamically computed measure. It is defined as aggregations of \textit{single measures}.

%\textit{Concrete services} are defined follwing the same grammar as the
%\textit{query}. The only difference is that concrete services do not have
%\textit{composed measures}.

\end{figure}

We use 7 concrete services to run our approach. In this example all the queries
have 6 \textit{abstract services} and 2 \textit{single measures}. The number of local variables (dependencies) and CSDs
is being modified to see how the algorithm works under these conditions.   
 
By now, the analysis identified that the factor that influenciates the Rhone
performance is the number of CSDs versus the number of abstract services in the
query since they increase the number of possible combinations of CSDs.  
We proceeded two types of analysis for the query $Q$ (\textit{Test 1} and
\textit{Test 2} - Figure 1). The first set of tests doesn't consider quality measures,
while the second consider the measures in the rewriting process. The number of
concrete services used in the analysis is from 2 until 35 services. Our
preliminary results show that our algorithm, considering the quality measures,
presents a better result for performance and the total number of rewritings.     

%To illustrate our approach in the next section, consider the \textit{concrete
% services} in table~\ref{table:concreteservices}.
