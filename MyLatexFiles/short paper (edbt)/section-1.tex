\section{Introduction}
Data integration is a well-know problem in the database domain (see~\cite{Halevy:2001}). 
Recently, with the emergency of cloud environments, this problem has also been threated in the service-oriented domains~\cite{Barhamgi2010,Benouaret2011,ba2014}.
Generally, these kind of applications deals with query rewriting problems.
\cite{Barhamgi2010} proposed a query rewriting approach which processes queries on data provider services. \cite{Benouaret2011} introduced a service composition framework to answer preference queries. In that approach, two algorithms based on~\cite{Barhamgi2010} are presented to rank the best rewritings based on previously computed scores.
%: one (i) to produce all possible rewritings before computing their scores and other (ii)
%which uses a quality metric that combines diversity and accuracy to,
%incrementally, rank services and to build the best rewritings.

In this context, the aim of our work is to present the early stages of our
ongoing work on developing the \textit{Rhone} service-based query rewriting
algorithm.
